# Post-hoc analysis of IMPAC challenge

## Script to generate post-hoc analysis figures

The labels of the private data are required to generate the figures. For
confidentiality issues, those data cannot be available. However, we made
available the code used to generate these figures.

These scripts used to generate the figures are available in the [script
directory](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/autism-figures/tree/master/scripts).
